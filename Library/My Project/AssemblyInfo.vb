'The following GUID is for the ID of the typelib if this project is exposed to COM
<Assembly: Guid("c9b9d85f-ff35-4947-bcaa-c4d15d2e5aa8")>

' Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:
'
'      Major Version
'      Minor Version 
'      Build Number
'      Revision
'
' You can specify all the values or you can default the Build and Revision Numbers 
' by using the '*' as shown below:
' <Assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.*")> 

' Note: The auto-increment for the version number does not auto-matically increment
' while the IDE is up and the project is open. However, for every session of development
' (in other words, every time you bring up a new instance of Visual Studio for that
' particular project) the version will automatically increment. 

<Assembly: AssemblyVersion("4.0.*")>

' If you exclude the AssemblyFileVersion, then the value is set to the same as 
' AssemblyVersion. Check out FileVersionInfo class for more info.

'<Assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.0.0.0")>
