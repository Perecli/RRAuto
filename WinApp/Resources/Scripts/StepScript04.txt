'These multi-line steps are awaited by the caller because they return a Task.

'The "Async" key word wraps the entire step into a Task and returns it.
'The "Async" declaration is required if any of the containing methods are Awaited.
o.Step("StepName1", Async Function()
	Await Delay(1000)
	PostMsg("Executing 1")
	Await Delay(1000)

'No "Async" is needed here because the only awaitable method is at the end
'so that task can be returned directly. Note that this is allowed because 
'no containing methods are Awaited. The Await is yielded to the caller.
